# Arduino Buyers Guide
  

This is a guide on all the different Arduino's
 
 The Arduino uno is the most common Arduino because it has a normal amount of IO. Also there is no need to solder.

 The Leonardo is almost like the uno but can be used as a hid device you can use it as a game pad or such. 

 The Mega 2560 is a uno with more IO can be use full is you need a lot of leds and such but be mindful that you could have so much code that you cant use all of it.

 The Micro is good to use on a breadboard and is compact

The Due also has a lot of IO has more memory than the Mega 2560
